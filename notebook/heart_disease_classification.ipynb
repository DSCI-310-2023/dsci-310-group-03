    "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide (Ahmad & Anderson, 2021). During 2020, the United States saw 690,882 deaths from this condition, compared to the 345,323 deaths from COVID-19 (Centre of Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). There are several risk factors for developing heart disease, and the consequences of heart disease vary in severity. The risk of death increases when other comorbidities are present, including COVID-19 (Madjid et al., 2020). Because this disease affects a large amount of the population, it puts significant strain on the healthcare system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus want to determine: Based on only two predictors gathered from health checkups performed by doctors, does somebody suffer from heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we analyze the Cleveland data file that contains 303 instances and records of basic information about the patient and multiple heart disease-related factors like blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, etc (Detrano, 1988). "

    "We will use the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for our data analysis (Timbers et al., 2022). KNN is a very well known classification algorithm, because it is very intuitive and does not make any major assumptions about the data. The only important requirement is that the distance between data points must represent their similarity. Furthermore, there are well-known ways to optimize a KNN model, which are implemented in the R library tidyverse, so it is easy to use.\n",

    "Our goal is to find the two best predictors for a KNN classification. However, taking all variables into account takes too long, so we exclude some, based on the exploration above:\n",
    "Based on Figure 1, `high blood sugar` did not show a significant increase between sick and healthy subjects. `Chest pain type` was removed from further analysis due to the initial study lacking documentation, as well as inconsistencies in the academic community for the terms and methods used to describe and categorize the types of chest pain. The academic community typically refers to only four types of angina: stable angina, unstable angina, microvascular angina, and vasospastic/variant angina (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Association, 2022). Therefore, it was challenging finding resources that properly described what abnormal angina was, as referenced in the original study. Additionally, `sex` as a predictor was excluded, as treating sex as binary is a topic we do not want to make a statement on.\n",

    "A research paper (Niederstrasser NG, Attridge N, 2022) shows that older adults have a higher incidence of musculoskeletal pain especially chronic pain and are generally less physically active than younger adults. However, the main reason is not due to aging but low physical activity and low wealth during their younger age. Another research (Ciolac, Emmanuel G, 2010) suggests that age does not affect the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular response to resistance and aerobic training in women. The elderly can exercise safely while having similar exercise intensity compared with the younger and the workload progression does not increase the risk of muscle incidence or injuries. In conclusion, both articles we found suggest that age does not directly affects exercise pain."

    "This analysis challenges some of the initial research done for this project.  For example, cholesterol is typically considered highly correlated with heart disease (2), however it appears not to be a strong predictor in this data set (Figure 3); there is not a significant distribution difference between the sick and healthy population (Figure 2a). On the other hand, exercise pain is a pretty good predictor for heart disease in this data set, which makes sense from a naive standpoint, as well as from the distribution of the data set (cf. Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning this project, we were optimistic about finding a model with high accuracy that could be used to predict heart disease. However, the highest accuracy found during this analysis was around 80%. Ideally, this analysis would have revealed a set of predictors with an even higher accuracy. This might be due to confounding variables, the slight imbalance (cf. Figure 4) and outliers within our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model offers a preliminary diagnosis, which helps healthcare professional to save time and medical costs when identifying high-risks population. Hence, age and exercise pain are appropriate predictors for this purpose as it is inexpensive, time-efficient and require minimal testing. Despite being a preliminary diagnosis tool for heart diseases, improvements such as taking confounding variables into account and/or using a bigger data set in future projects would help improve the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several open questions: Can our model be improved to diagnose the severity of heart disease in patients? Are we able to improve our accuracy and false negative rate by taking more predictors? Are there predictors that are less expensive but still achieve a similar accuracy? In our data set, most formulas with high accuracy involve expensive tests (cf. Figure 3). Lastly, is there a more effective and convenient predictor for diagnosing heart disease than the ones used in this analysis? One example for this might be a family history of heart diseases (American Heart Association, 2015)."
