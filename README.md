## About
The project is developed upon the dsci100 term project by the contributors listed above. We aim to determine: Based on only two predictors gathered from health checkups performed by doctors, does somebody suffer from heart disease?

To answer this question, we analyze the Cleveland data file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease, containing data collected by Robert Detrano at the V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation in 1988. This dataset contains 303 instances. 

We attempt to build a classification model using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm to predict heart disease diagnosis. Our model offers a preliminary diagnosis based 2 symptoms. This can save medical costs for patients who are properly diagnosed with heart disease by our model as well as diagnostic time.
