## About
The project is developed upon the dsci100 term project by the contributors listed above. Permission to reuse the data analysis has been given by all contributors. We aim to determine: Based on only two predictors gathered from health checkups performed by doctors, does somebody suffer from heart disease?

To answer this question, we analyze the Cleveland data file from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease, containing data collected by Robert Detrano at the V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation in 1988. This dataset contains 303 instances. 

We attempt to build a classification model using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm to predict heart disease diagnosis. Our model offers a preliminary diagnosis based 2 symptoms. This can save medical costs for patients who are properly diagnosed with heart disease by our model as well as diagnostic time.
